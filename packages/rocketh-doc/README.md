# rocketh-doc

`rocketh-doc` generates documentation from deployments files, following rocketh format composed of address,abi, etc....

There is plan to support doc generation from compiled artifacts too, but no work has started on that.

We welcome contribution if you are interested to support that feature.

For now rocketh-doc is intended to be used to document a set of deployed contract.

Note that documentation template (written in handlebars) have access to the deployment address.
