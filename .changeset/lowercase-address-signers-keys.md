Fix "cannot get signer" for named accounts declared with a private key, a signer protocol, or a checksummed address. `addressSigners` is now keyed by a lowercased address at both write sites and at the leftover-account filter, matching every reader (which already lowercased). `resolveAccountOrUndefined` now normalises like `resolveAccount`, so both resolvers agree. Address values exposed by `namedAccounts`/`unnamedAccounts` are unchanged.
