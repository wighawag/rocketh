Add the `'ask'` unknown-signer policy and the interactive resolver at the broadcast seam.

`onUnknownSigner` is now `'throw' | 'ask' | 'auto'`, and `'auto'` (still the default) is CAPABILITY-AWARE: it resolves to `'ask'` where the run can ask a human for text (`env.canPromptForText()`, i.e. a `PromptExecutor` implementing `promptText`) and to `'throw'` where it cannot. Capability is a CEILING, so an explicit `'ask'` also degrades to `'throw'` without a prompt: CI never prompts and never hangs.

Under `'ask'`, a transaction whose `from` is unsignable PAUSES: rocketh presents the exact transaction (the undegraded `UnknownSignerError` message), the user executes it out-of-band on their Safe and pastes the resulting transaction hash, and the run CONTINUES through the same pending-transaction pipeline a normal broadcast uses, returning a real receipt with no send RPC attempted. Because the resolver resolves instead of throwing, a multi-step governed action pauses at each unsignable step and completes in ONE run. The pasted hash is registered with the transaction-hash tracker, so gas reporting does not omit an externally-executed transaction. A receipt without a successful status fails loudly, naming both the transaction and the pasted hash, and saves nothing.

Answering "cannot sign" (or pressing enter, aborting the prompt, or failing to paste a valid hash) degrades to the existing defer workflow: the full transaction is printed and the same `UnknownSignerError` is thrown, still caught by `catchUnknownSigner`. Signable accounts are entirely unaffected — the policy is still consulted only inside the `unsignable` branch, so `local`, `node` and `impersonated` accounts broadcast exactly as before, and a pre-signed `raw` transaction never reaches the seam. `@rocketh/unknown-signer` only gains doc-comment corrections now that `'ask'` exists.
